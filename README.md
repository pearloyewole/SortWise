# SortWise - Hackathon Project

https://sort-wise.vercel.app/ 

### Mission

SortWise is a web app designed to help users quickly and confidently classify waste for recycling and disposal. Our goal is to make sustainability more approachable and intuitive for everyone, regardless of background or ability.

Sustainability shouldn't require a learning curve. Many people want to recycle correctly but struggle with inconsistent rules, unclear labeling, or limited access to resources. Users who can’t visually identify waste types can upload a photo instead of reading small print or distinguishing subtle material differences. Additionally clear language and simple layouts reduce cognitive load for those with learning or attention-related disabilities.

SortWise addresses this by:

- **Allowing image-based trash classification** (via a machine learning model),
- Providing clear feedback on what kind of waste is being submitted, and
- Laying the foundation for location-specific recycling guidance in the future.

### Features 

Trash classification from uploaded images  
Support for screen readers (semantic html + standard on-screen text, as well as alternative text for images)
Accessible UI with keyboard navigation+touch and readable color contrast  

### Tools Used
TensorFlow – Trained waste classification model
FastAPI – Served predictions via REST API
React – Built frontend for image/video upload & result display
Axios – Connected frontend to backend
Render – Hosted Python backend (free tier)
Vercel – Deployed React frontend
GitHub – Collaborated with a teammate using branches & pull requests
PIL, OpenCV, NumPy – Image/video preprocessing in Python


### Sustainability Is for Everyone

We recognize that meaningful environmental action must be accessible to all. That includes designing tools that are easy to use — whether you're a busy parent, a non-technical user, or someone with a disability. SortWise aims to reduce the friction between good intentions and practical action.
### Contribute

We welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions — especially from those in sustainability, accessibility, or education.
